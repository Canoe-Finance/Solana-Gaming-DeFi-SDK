The growth of game users has brought tremendous changes to the gaming industry, especially the mobile game market. The industry is raking in more than billions in revenue and consequently, there is a vast opportunity for operators in this space. Canoe is able to see the opportunity and is ready to take it. That is why Canoe wants to build a gaming SDK for developers of Web 2.0 game companies during solana hackathon. As mobile games have a larger user base than other types and can be played anywhere and anytime, the gaming SDK will be directly compatible with the Unity Engine.
